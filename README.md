# I set out on this project to achieve three things:
* Obtain all of my streaming data from Spotify and featurize it using the spotipy API
* Build a classifier to accuractely predict liked songs in my streaming history
* Perform some EDA on my streaming history to discover historical top genres and artists
* Cluster the top genres and artists using NLP techniques (word2vec) and using simple PCA on the featurized dataset
